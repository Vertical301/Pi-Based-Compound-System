# Pi-Based-Compound-System
Smart Contract for Pi Token to never lose value and continually grow using the pi mathematical equation to compound value on itself


The pi token will use what’s called a pi-based compounding system. This will have pi grow over time and be at stable value without losing its value. Using the pi mathematical equation of 3.14159 with that growing percentage it can look like a stable coin start at a low value and grow to a high value without ever losing value. It can grow but be stable at the same time without having a backing asset. If you understand the math behind the equation of Pi it will make more sense its actually a formula. 

V(t) = V_0 * (1 + (π / 100))t


This will allow the token to not be volatile like other cryptocurrencies, but not needing an asset to back it like a stable coin. So it can be used as a store or value as well as for everyday transactions. Meaning it can start at $314 and grow to $314,159 over time in a very short time without a market cap.
